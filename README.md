# Brighte Eats App (Assessment Project)

##### Disclaimer: This project was completed as part of a technical assessment/exam for Brighte. All code and design decisions were made solely for the purposes of this assessment.

## Overview

Brighte wants to collect expressions of interest for a new product called Brighte Eats and view those leads in a dashboard. Essentially, this is about gauging customer interest and tracking potential leads.

## Functional Requirements

These are the key features the system should provide:

- Expression of Interest Form: A form or interface for users to submit their interest in Brighte Eats. Users should indicate which services they are interested in:

```
Delivery | Pick-up | Payment
```

- Dashboard for Leads: A dashboard where Brighte staff can view all submitted expressions of interest. Dashboard features could include:

```
List of all users who submitted interest.
Which services each user is interested in (delivery, pick-up, payment).
```
